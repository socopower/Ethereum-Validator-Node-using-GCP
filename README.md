In this README file, you will find everything you need to successfully deploy your Ethereum Validator Node in Goerli Testnet Network using Teku/Besu Clients as Execution and Consensus Clients respectively with the help of Google Cloud Platform services.

### NOTE:
Since the goal of this guide is to teach you how to Deploy the Server on GCP, and since I don't plan to keep the server for a long time, I will only use 500 GB of disk storage.

If you plan to contribute to the maintenance of the Goerli network by integrating your own node, I recommend configuring your server with the following requirements.
