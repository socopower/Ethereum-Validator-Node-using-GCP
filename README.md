# Ethereum Validator Node using GCP
Hi!, in the following link you will find everything you need to successfully deploy your Ethereum Validator Node in *Goerli* Testnet Network using *Teku/Besu* Clients as Consensus and Execution Clients respectively with the help of **Google Cloud Platform** services.

### I invite you to read my Full article: [Full Article Here](https://medium.com/@kristhiann97).

### NOTE:
Since the goal of this guide is to teach you how to Deploy the Server on GCP, and since I don't plan to keep the server for a long time, I will only use **500 GB of disk storage.**

If you plan to contribute to the maintenance of the Goerli network by integrating your own node, I recommend configuring your server with the following requirements.
